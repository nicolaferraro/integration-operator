# Camel Classic Runtime for Kamel

This is a simple library to run Apache Camel routes using a yaml syntax.

A Docker image is also available (Camel on Spring-Boot): `nferraro/camel-classic-runtime-spring-boot:latest`.
The routes context for the docker image should be passed to the image in the `CAMEL_FLOWS`
environment variable.
